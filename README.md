# Global Meteorite Impact Analysis with XGBoost Prediction

![Global Mass Distribution](images/Global%20Mass%20Distribution.png)


Welcome to our comprehensive repository, where we delve into the enigmatic world of meteorites. Our project harnesses the rich dataset from NASA's meteorite landings, available on Kaggle, to explore and analyze the patterns of meteorite impacts on Earth. Through meticulous data exploration and analysis, we've unearthed insights into the mass distribution of meteorites and their geographical dispersion.

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook filled with intricate analysis, visual representations like the one displayed above, and a robust XGBoost model that we've engineered to predict the frequency of future meteorite impacts. This predictive model aims to provide a scientific basis for understanding the potential risks and frequencies of extraterrestrial objects gracing our planet.
